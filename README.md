# Annotation Tools

## Description
Annotation Tools are a series of MATLAB applications designed for the purpose of analysing brain images.
This project is developed and maintained by the [Boston University Neurophotonics Center](http://www.bu.edu/neurophotonics/).

## Installation
- Install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html)
- Retrieve scripts ([clone](https://github.com/BUNPC/Annotation_tools.git) or [download](https://github.com/BUNPC/Annotation_tools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))

Note: These applications are designed to function on Windows OS, thus some features may not be available on Mac OS.
